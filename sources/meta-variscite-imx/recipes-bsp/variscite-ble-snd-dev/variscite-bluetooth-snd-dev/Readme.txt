info: Connect device to Mobile phone by bluetooth and make sure that sound is playing using connector J 19 in device.

1. Start the device in A2DP server mode, run the following command (Into console of device):
# /opt/var-bluetooth-snd-dev/./bluetooth-snd-server.sh

2. scan and connecting the external device to Variscite board over bluetooth

3. Trusr external device to Variscite board
/opt/var-bluetooth-snd-dev/./bluetooth-snd-server.sh -t C8:14:79:27:F1:82
Where "bd adress" we can get with command "hcitool scan"

For example:
# /opt/var-bluetooth-snd-dev/./bluetooth-snd-server.sh
.. connect external device via bluetooth
# /opt/var-bluetooth-snd-dev/./bluetooth-snd-server.sh -t C8:14:79:27:F1:82

On the side of the client device to connect to the device VAR-A2DP and play sound through it.
For audio playback, make sure you connect headphones or speakers to the connector J19 in device.

Note: If sound not playing you can see paragraph "FAQ".

info: Connect and play sound through bluetooth headphones.

---- connect ----
Into console of device:
1. Start utilite "bluetoothctl":
	root@imx6ul-var-dart:~# bluetoothctl

example:
 bluetoothctl
 [NEW] Controller F8:DC:7A:07:8D:A6 VAR-A2DP [default]
 [NEW] Device C8:14:79:27:F1:82 SM-T315
 [bluetooth]#

2. Prepare to —Åonnection:
	[bluetooth]# power on
	[bluetooth]# agent on
	[bluetooth]# default-agent

example:
 [bluetooth]# power on
 Changing power on succeeded
 [bluetooth]# agent on
 Agent registered
 [bluetooth]# default-agent
 Default agent request successful
 [bluetooth]#

4. Now make sure that your headphones are in pairing mode. They need to show up.

3. Enable scanning
	[bluetooth]# scan on

example:

4. Disable scanning
	[bluetooth]# scan off

example:
 [bluetooth]# scan off
 Discovery stopped
 [CHG] Controller F8:DC:7A:07:8D:A6 Discovering: no
 [bluetooth]#

5. pairing device
	[bluetooth]# pair 00:06:F7:B3:E9:ED

6. connecting device
	[bluetooth]# connect 00:06:F7:B3:E9:ED

example:
 [bluetooth]# connect 00:06:F7:B3:E9:ED

7. trusting device
	[MM100]# trust 00:06:F7:B3:E9:ED

example:
 [MM100]# trust 00:06:F7:B3:E9:ED
 [CHG] Device 00:06:F7:B3:E9:ED Trusted: yes
 Changing 00:06:F7:B3:E9:ED trust succeeded
 [MM100]#

8. quit from bluetoothctl console
	[MM100]# quit

We are interested in Card # 6.

2. Switch a2dp profile
	# pactl set-card-profile <card #id from item 1> a2dp_sink

example:
 root@imx6ul-var-dart:~# pactl set-card-profile 6 a2dp_sink
 root@imx6ul-var-dart:~#

3. play wav file from pulse subsystem to bluetooth headphones
	# paplay -p  --device=bluez_sink.XX_XX_XX_XX_XX_XX test.wav
Where:
XX_XX_XX_XX_XX_XX - bd_add from item 1
test.wav - is the path to audio file

example:
 root@imx6ul-var-dart:~# paplay -p --device=bluez_sink.00_06_F7_B3_E9_ED test.wav

1. If sound not playing of headseat connecter (device in server mode)
It may not be configured ALSA, use this command:

# amixer set 'Output Mixer HiFi' on
